# Card Search Syntax

This page documents the `q` syntax used by the card routes:

```text
GET /cards?q=...
POST /cards/search?q=...
GET /cards/random?q=...
```

For route shapes, response fields, collection search, and examples, see
[Cards API](../api/cards.md). For shared response, pagination, caching, and
rate-limit behavior, see [API Overview](../api/index.md) and
[Rate Limits](rate-limits.md).

The syntax is inspired by Scryfall search, but it is not a full clone. Videre's
card catalog is MTGO-focused, so the supported terms are the ones backed by
MTGO catalog fields, generated legality data, and Videre's card search indexes.

The simplest way to think about `q` is that it is a compact form for building
the same filters exposed as query parameters. Use plain words for human search.
Use tagged terms when a word must apply to a specific field. Use comparison
operators when the field needs ordering, such as mana value, release date, or
rarity.

## How Queries Are Parsed

The parser splits `q` on whitespace. Text inside double quotes stays together:

```text
lightning bolt
name:"Lightning Bolt"
artist:"Christopher Rush"
```

Tokens that are not recognized as operators or tagged terms remain as plain
text search. Plain text searches card names and oracle text using the database
search index:

```text
/cards?q=lightning bolt
/cards?q=draw a card
```

Most tagged terms fill one API filter. If the same filter is supplied both as an
explicit query parameter and inside `q`, the explicit query parameter wins. If a
singleton filter appears twice inside `q`, the first recognized value wins.
Type terms are the main exception: repeated `t:` terms are combined.

The `q` parameter accepts letters, numbers, punctuation, symbols, and
whitespace. Control characters are rejected before parsing.

This parser does not implement full boolean grouping. There is no parenthesized
`or` syntax, and negation is deliberately narrow. When a query needs structured
behavior that is easier to express in code, prefer explicit query parameters
over trying to encode an entire query language into one string.

## Common Recipes

These examples show the patterns most clients should start with:

```text
/cards?q=lightning bolt
/cards?q=!"Lightning Bolt"&unique=prints
/cards?q=!"Lightning Bolt" year>2020&unique=prints
/cards?q=t:artifact -t:creature
/cards?q=format:modern mv<=2
/cards?q=artist:"Christopher Rush" set:1E
/cards?q=is:token name:clue
```

Use `unique=prints` when the UI is about MTGO printings, images, set releases,
or collection ownership. Use `unique=cards` when the UI is about oracle-level
card discovery and should collapse reprints.

For search boxes, send the user's text as plain `q` until the UI deliberately
exposes advanced filters. Plain text ranking is usually a better default than
forcing user input into `name:` because untagged text can also match oracle
text.

## Exact Name Shorthand

Use `!"..."` for an exact card-name lookup inside `q`:

```text
/cards?q=!"Lightning Bolt"
/cards?q=!"Lightning Bolt" year>2020
```

This maps to the same exact-name filter as `exact=Lightning Bolt`. It still
returns print rows unless `unique=cards` is supplied.

## Name And Text

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name:bolt` | Card name contains `bolt`. |
| `n:bolt` | Alias for `name`. |
| `exact:"Lightning Bolt"` | Exact normalized card name. |
| `oracle:"draw a card"` | Oracle text contains the value. |
| `o:"draw a card"` | Alias for `oracle`. |

Untagged text searches both names and oracle text. Use `name:` or `oracle:` when
the field matters.

`exact:` is stricter than `name:`. It is appropriate when a client has already
resolved a card name from autocomplete or from a known decklist entry. It is not
as forgiving for partial user input.

## Set, Printing, And Catalog Terms

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `set:MM2` | MTGO set code equals `MM2`. |
| `e:MM2` | Alias for `set`. |
| `edition:MM2` | Alias for `set`. |
| `number:150` | Collector number equals `150`. |
| `collector:150` | Alias for `number`. |
| `cn:150` | Alias for `number`. |
| `cid:605` | MTGO catalog ID equals `605`. |
| `catalog:605` | Alias for `cid`. |
| `mtgoid:605` | Alias for `cid`. |
| `artid:147` | Art ID equals `147`. |
| `art:147` | Alias for `artid`. |
| `art_id:147` | Alias for `artid`. |
| `frame:2015` | Frame style equals `2015`. |
| `frame_style:2015` | Alias for `frame`. |
| `promo:prerelease` | Promo label contains `prerelease`. |
| `promo_label:prerelease` | Alias for `promo`. |

Set codes are compared case-insensitively. Collector numbers are exact string
matches, which matters for MTGO catalog values that contain letters or suffixes.

Catalog IDs identify MTGO catalog rows, not oracle cards. They are the right
identifier for card images, collection matching, and exact printing lookup.
Oracle-level grouping is controlled separately with `unique=cards`.

## Colors

Color search uses MTGO's computed color masks. Color values can use `WUBRG`,
`C`, or color names.

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `c:U` | At least blue. |
| `c>=WU` | At least white and blue. |
| `c<=U` | At most blue. Colorless cards also match. |
| `c=RG` | Exactly red and green. |
| `color:white` | Alias for `c:white`. |
| `colors:colorless` | Match colorless through the color filter. |
| `id:RG` | Color identity at most red and green. |
| `id>=R` | Color identity includes red. |
| `identity=UB` | Color identity exactly blue and black. |
| `color_identity<=WU` | Alias for `id<=WU`. |

The default operator differs by field:

| Field | Default |
|---|---|
| `c`, `color`, `colors` | `>=` |
| `id`, `identity`, `color_identity` | `<=` |

Only `=`, `<=`, and `>=` are supported for color comparisons.

The default operators follow common deckbuilding search behavior. `c:U` means
"has blue among its colors", while `id:RG` means "can fit in a red-green color
identity". Use explicit operators when that default is not what the UI needs.

## Numeric And Date Comparisons

Numeric terms support `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

| Syntax | Field |
|---|---|
| `mv<=2` | Mana value. |
| `cmc<=2` | Alias for mana value. |
| `mana_value<=2` | Mana value. |
| `pow>=4` | Power. |
| `power>=4` | Power. |
| `tou<4` | Toughness. |
| `toughness<4` | Toughness. |
| `loy>=3` | Loyalty. |
| `loyalty>=3` | Loyalty. |
| `def>=4` | Defense. |
| `defense>=4` | Defense. |
| `year>2020` | Set release year. |

Date terms also support `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `released>=2024-01-01` | Set release date on or after the date. |
| `release<2020-01-01` | Alias for `released`. |
| `date=2026-06-23` | Alias for `released`. |

Date values should use `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Power, toughness, loyalty, and defense are stored as printed text in the card
catalog, so the API compares their numeric value when one can be derived. Cards
with non-numeric printed values may not behave like ordinary numeric cards for
these filters.

## Mana Cost

Mana-cost filters match the exact printed mana cost:

```text
/cards?q=m:{R}
/cards?q=mana:{U}{U}
/cards?q=cost={2}{G}
```

Supported keys are `m`, `mana`, `cost`, and `mana_cost`. Cost comparison is not
numeric. Use `mv`, `cmc`, or `mana_value` for numeric mana-value comparisons.

Mana cost is exact by design. A search for `m:{R}` matches cards printed with
exactly `{R}`, not every card that contains red mana in its cost.

## Rarity

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `r:common` | Exact rarity. |
| `rarity:rare` | Exact rarity. |
| `r>=rare` | Rare or mythic. |
| `r<rare` | Common or uncommon. |

Rarity comparisons use the normal paper rarity ladder: `common`, `uncommon`,
`rare`, and `mythic`. MTGO-specific rarity names such as `token`, `bonus`, and
`promo` can be used as exact values, but they are not part of the comparison
ladder.

Short aliases such as `c`, `u`, `r`, and `m` are normalized through the same
generated rarity alias table used by the API validators.

Rarity comparison is intended for the normal rarity ladder only. If a client is
filtering MTGO-specific values such as `token` or `promo`, use exact rarity
matching rather than `>` or `<`.

## Types

Type terms search card types, supertypes, subtypes, and multi-word text in the
printed type line.

```text
/cards?q=t:artifact
/cards?q=t:artifact -t:creature
/cards?q=type:legendary type:creature
/cards?q=t:"time lord"
```

Repeated type terms are combined. Included terms must all match. Excluded terms
must not match.

If a query includes the same term as both included and excluded, the API treats
the query as empty and returns no results:

```text
/cards?q=t:artifact -t:artifact
```

Single-word type terms match parsed type, supertype, and subtype arrays. A
quoted multi-word type term falls back to a contains check against the printed
type line, which is useful for cases such as `t:"time lord"`.

## Formats And Legalities

`format:` filters to cards that are legal in the format:

```text
/cards?q=format:modern
/cards?q=f:pioneer
```

The API also accepts legality terms:

```text
/cards?q=legal:modern
/cards?q=banned:modern
/cards?q=restricted:vintage
/cards?q=legality:modern:banned
/cards?q=legality:banned
```

Legalities are oracle-based. If any printing of the same oracle card has that
format legality, matching print rows can appear in the result.

Supported legality values are:

- `legal`
- `not_legal`
- `banned`
- `restricted`
- `suspended`

When a query supplies `format` without an explicit legality, the API assumes
`legal`.

This mirrors the common use case for format search: most callers asking for
`format:modern` expect cards that are currently legal in Modern. Use explicit
legality terms when the UI needs banned, restricted, suspended, or not-legal
cards.

## Artist And Flavor Text

```text
/cards?q=artist:"Christopher Rush"
/cards?q=a:"Christopher Rush"
/cards?q=illustrator:"Christopher Rush"
/cards?q=flavor:"when dragons"
/cards?q=ft:"when dragons"
```

Artist and flavor filters search card and face attributes. They are
case-insensitive contains filters.

These fields are useful for catalog discovery, but they are not part of normal
deck legality or gameplay filtering. They may be missing on older or unusual
MTGO catalog rows when the upstream data does not provide them.

## Boolean Flags

Use `is:` terms for API-supported card flags:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `is:token` | Return token rows. |
| `is:promo` | Promo label is present. |
| `is:multiface` | The catalog entry has additional face rows. |
| `is:multi-face` | Alias for `is:multiface`. |
| `is:dfc` | Alias for `is:multiface`. |
| `is:split` | Split or subcard relationship is present. |
| `is:subcard` | Alias for `is:split`. |
| `-is:token` | Keep token rows excluded. This is also the default. |
| `-is:promo` | Promo label is not present. |
| `-is:multiface` | No additional face rows. |
| `-is:split` | No split or subcard relationship. |

Normal searches hide tokens by default. `is:token` changes the search to token
rows. `include_tokens=true` is a query parameter, not a `q` term; use it when
tokens may appear alongside normal cards.

`is:multiface` and `is:split` are MTGO catalog predicates. They are useful for
finding cards with additional face rows or split/subcard relationships, but
they are not a complete paper-layout taxonomy.

## Sorting And Uniqueness

Sort and uniqueness terms can be supplied through `q`:

```text
/cards?q=dragon order:released dir:desc
/cards?q=lightning bolt sort:name direction:asc
/cards?q=lightning bolt unique:prints
/cards?q=lightning bolt unique:cards
```

Supported order values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rank` | Search rank, then stable card fields. |
| `relevance` | Alias for `rank`. |
| `name` | Card name. |
| `mv` | Mana value. |
| `cmc` | Alias for mana value. |
| `mana` | Alias for mana value. |
| `mana_value` | Mana value. |
| `set` | Set code and collector number. |
| `released` | Set release date. |
| `release` | Alias for `released`. |

Supported directions are `asc`, `ascending`, `desc`, and `descending`.

Supported unique values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prints` | Return print rows. |
| `printings` | Alias for `prints`. |
| `cards` | Collapse to one representative per oracle card. |
| `card` | Alias for `cards`. |
| `oracle` | Alias for `cards`. |
| `oracles` | Alias for `cards`. |

When `order` is omitted, text searches default to `rank`; non-text searches
default to `name`. When `unique` is omitted, `/cards` returns print rows.

Sorting happens after filters are applied. For collection-aware searches with
`mode=rank`, collection membership is applied before the normal sort so owned
cards appear first within the matching result set.

## Negation

Negation is currently supported for type terms and `is:` flags:

```text
/cards?q=t:artifact -t:creature
/cards?q=-is:token
/cards?q=-is:promo
/cards?q=-is:multiface
```

Negation is not a general operator. A token such as `-artist:foo` is not parsed
as "artist is not foo"; it falls back to plain text search.

If a UI needs general negative filters, add explicit API parameters or a
dedicated route-level option instead of relying on unimplemented `q` syntax.

## URL Encoding

Characters such as spaces, quotes, braces, `<`, `>`, and `=` should be URL
encoded by clients. These examples show the readable form:

```text
/cards?q=!"Lightning Bolt" year>2020
/cards?q=m:{R}
/cards?q=c<=U
```

A browser or HTTP client should send the encoded form:

```text
/cards?q=!%22Lightning%20Bolt%22%20year%3E2020
/cards?q=m%3A%7BR%7D
/cards?q=c%3C%3DU
```

Most client libraries handle this when query parameters are supplied as a map or
`URLSearchParams`. Manual string concatenation is easy to get wrong because
quotes, braces, and comparison operators all have special meaning in URLs.

## Unsupported Scryfall Terms

The parser intentionally supports a smaller grammar than Scryfall. Terms that
are not listed here either become plain text search or are rejected by the route
validator. Current gaps include full Scryfall layout predicates, keyword ability
predicates, artist IDs, watermark and border filters, price filters, game and
paper-set availability terms, and full boolean grouping.

Prefer explicit API parameters when building structured client UIs. Use `q` for
human-entered search strings, comparison operators, and compact advanced search
syntax.
